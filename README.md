COMS 227: Computer programming using objects as the mechanism for modularity, abstraction, and code reuse. Instance variables, methods, and encapsulation. Review of control structures for conditionals and iteration. Developing algorithms on strings, arrays, and lists. Recursion, searching, and sorting. Text parsing and file I/O. Interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes. Exception handling. Tools for unit testing and debugging. Emphasis on a disciplined approach to specification, code development, and testing. Course intended for majors in computer science and related fields.

COMS 228: An object-oriented approach to data structures and algorithms. Object-oriented analysis, design, and programming, with emphasis on data abstraction, inheritance and subtype polymorphism, and generics. Abstract data type specification and correctness. Collections including lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, maps, hash tables, and graphs. Big-O notation and algorithm analysis. Searching and sorting. Graph search and shortest path algorithms. Emphasis on object-oriented design, writing and documenting medium-sized programs.
